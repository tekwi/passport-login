# alexa-verifier
Verify HTTP requests sent to an Alexa skill are sent from Amazon.


### motivation
Part of the certication process for alexa skills hosted on a generic web service (i.e., not AWS Lambda) is that your skill must validate requests are actually coming from Amazon. This is enforced by checking:

* the timestamp of the request
* the validity of the certificate
* the signature of the the request signed with the aforementioned certificate

This module provides a function which handles this validation.


### api

```javascript
verifier(cert_url, signature, requestRawBody, callback)
```

* `cert_url`  full url of the certificate to verify (from the HTTP request header named `signaturecertchainurl`)
* `signature` signature of the request (from the HTTP request header named `signature`)
* `requestRawBody`  full body string from POST request
* `callback`  completion function. has 1 argument which indicates error. falsey when verification passes


### express example usage

This module is framework-agnostic, but since I'm using express and since that seems to be a popular choice I'll 
provide an example of that.

One thing to note: if you're using the ever-popular `body-parser` module to parse request bodies, you'll need some
magic to actually get the raw request body. Much of the following snippet is related to getting at the raw request body.


```coffeescript
express  = require 'express'
verifier = require 'alexa-verifier'


app = express()

# the alexa API calls specify an HTTPS certificate that must be validated.
# the validation uses the request's raw POST body which isn't available from
# the body parser module. so we look for any requests that include a
# signaturecertchainurl HTTP request header, parse out the entire body as a
# text string, and set a flag on the request object so other body parser
# middlewares don't try to parse the body again
app.use (req, res, next) ->
  if not req.headers.signaturecertchainurl
    return next()
  # mark the request body as already having been parsed so it's ignored by
  # other body parser middlewares
  req._body = true

  req.rawBody = ''
  req.on 'data', (data) ->
    req.rawBody += data
  req.on 'end', ->
    try
      req.body = JSON.parse req.rawBody
    catch er 
      req.body = {}

    cert_url  = req.headers.signaturecertchainurl
    signature = req.headers.signature
    requestBody = req.rawBody
    verifier cert_url, signature, requestBody, (er) ->
      if er 
        console.error 'error validating the alexa cert:', er
        res.status(401).json { status: 'failure', reason: er }
      else
        next()

# other body parsers, etc follow ...
```
